# This is a basic ping test batch script

I made this because my internet speed seemed unstable.

* How to use: download and run the .bat file
* If your antivirus prevents the file from downloading or running, you may need to manually disable it before running the script
* If you are unsure, you can check for viruses in the code yourself by right click -> edit instead of running. It is totally safe to run
* I might add more features in the future, but for now it's just a basic script
